I am XX! 

I am a Lecturer in Statistics at the Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Otago, New Zealand. 

I received B.Sc. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2011 and Ph.D. degree from the Dept. of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at City University of Hong Kong in 2016. 

My current research focuses on industrial statistics and point process modelling.
